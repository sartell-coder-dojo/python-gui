# python-gui
September CoderDojo Topic

Last session we discussed source control management (SCM) systems and specifically focused on one popular SCM: Git.

Next session, I think it would be fun to try out programming in Python (to compare with the Java programming we've been doing). There is a good Python starter project I found at https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-guis which I will use as a launch point for the discussion.

# Verify python 3 installation
From a terminal or command prompt window run the following command:

```
python --version
```

If the response is `Python 3.x.x` then you are good. If not, try:

```
python3 --version
```

If neither command gives the expected output, follow the instructions at https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-guis/1 to install Python3 on your systems

# Install guizero

With python3 installed, run

`sudo pip3 install guizero`

or follow the instructions at https://lawsie.github.io/guizero/
