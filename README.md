# python-gui
September CoderDojo Topic

Last session we discussed source control management (SCM) systems and specifically focused on one popular SCM: Git.

Next session, I think it would be fun to try out programming in Python (to compare with the Java programming we've been doing). There is a good Python starter project I found at https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-guis which I will use as a launch point for the discussion.
